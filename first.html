			<h1 class="head2" style="color:blue;">Origin Of Mobile</h1>
			<p class="para1" >
				The mobile phone first appeared in India sometime in the nineties. It was a bulky box quite similar to the landlines we still use today. It had an equally big antenna and was heavy and cumbersome to carry. That was just the beginning.Very soon they were all over the place. With the alarming speed at which they shrunk in size, these pocket sized wonders, sure packed a punch. It is a joint venture mobile manufacturing company between the Bangalore (United Telelinks Limited) and Noida (Jaina Marketing & Associates). Karbonn Mobiles has a strategic tie-up with Sistema Shyam TeleServices Limited.Karbonn has a presence in countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and in the Middle East and Europe as well.

			<p>Users can share and link to each image. The hash suffix gets two extra parameters: gid (the gallery index) and pid (the picture index).This feature comes as a module. You can exclude it from the build entirely, or fork it to fit the requirements of your product’s URL structure.</p>


			<p>Photos are displayed before they fully load. This feature is disabled on touch devices because it could cause swipe transitions to lag.Pass the source of a thumbnail to PhotoSwipe, which will display it instantly and load the full-sized image over top.
